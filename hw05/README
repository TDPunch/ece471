ECE471 HW5 -- Fall 2019

Name: Tyler Punch


7. My something cool is making the ECE471 message scroll from left to right.

8.
 a). The part of the Raspberry Pi hardware in charge of the inital boot 
process is the is the Videocore or GPU. The GPU loads and executes the 
first stage of the boot process from Read Only Memory (ROM). ARM based
embedded systems do not have the same boot process. ARM systems use 
a software boot loader called uBoot instead.

 b). The /boot partition is a FAT32 filesystem because it works on
most machines. The RPi boot firmware is smart enough to mount a FAT 
partition.

 c). The generic name for the program responsible for loading the OS
kernel into memory and running it is bootcode.bin.

 d). Becuase addresses 0-2 and 0x78-0x7F are reserved addresses.

9.
 a). There are 131 lines in the display_final.c file 
 b). There are 77 lines in the diff file.
