Answers to homework questions in Part7:

a. If you want to learn more about the ls program you would
run the command man ls. This opens the manual page for the ls
function.

b. The -a option on the ls program will force it to show all
entries in the current directories, even the ones containing
a (.). Normally ls does not show these entries.

c. One reason why Linux is used in embedded system design is
becuase the Linux OS is open source. This means that it is completly
free for everyone and source code is readily available.

d. I currently have my pi connected to my TV at home with a USB keyboard
and wireless USB mouse. I'm connected to my at home wifi network
and that is how I downloaded the homework 2 file.
