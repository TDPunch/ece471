ECE471 HW9 -- Fall 2019

Name: Tyler Punch


4. Test inputs:
	a) 72.9, I used this value to test case a.
	b) 4.9, I used this to ensure leading zeroes were suppressed.
	c) -10.5, I used this to test case b with value < -10.0.
	d) -100.0, I used this to test the invalid temp case.
	e) 893.5, I used this to test case c.
	NOTE: I used a few other test cases because I added rounding
	for accuracy and another case b test with value > -9.9 these are
	found in test_display.c.

7:
  a. Mars probe failed due to failure to convert units.
  b. Becuase it's good practice to do that so if ever doing anything important
you have the protocol drilled into your head. It's also good experience so
can go back and possibly use that code to help you in the future. Not to 
mention it would be helpful for others to read and understand your code
if you like to go on stack overflow.

8.
  a. Changed date to February 29, 2020.
  b. Becuase date is out of range.
  c. Becuase changing the filestamp is very simple.
