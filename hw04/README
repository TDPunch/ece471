ECE 471 Fall 2019 -- Homework 4

Name: Tyler Punch

NOTE: Im curious, my delay after export had to be longer for GPIO 18 then 
it did for GPIO 17. Any idea why that is?

What you did for something cool (if applicable): For something cool I programmed
GPIO pin 18 to transmit a message in morse code. The message it transmits is
ECE471.


Answers to Question #5:

a. It is good to use usleep() over a busy loop becuase a busy loop wastes clock 
cycles whereas usleep() does not.

b. Having an OS makes life easier when programming GPIO's because you don't have
to configure several individual bits for clocks and modes etc. With an OS all
that has to be done is export the PIN and write to two files to get it to do what
you want. In this way the code is a lot easier to understand too since you
write "in" or "out" for an input or output as opposed to some arbitrary 
hexidecimal number to set individual bits. 

c. One limitation the OS imposes is that after exporting you have to delay a 
short time before trying to write anything to that GPIO pin. The OS needs time
to export the PINs. 

Answers to Question #6:

a. Machine type: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Plus Rev 1.3

b. Kernel version: Linux raspberrypi 4.19.66-v7+ #1253 SMP

c. Free Disk space: 8.4GB of available space

d. The -h option of the df command makes the output of df human readable.
To elaborate it outputs the space values in ways we as humans are used to 
reading them i.e. GB, MB, KB etc.
