ECE471 Fall 2019 -- HW7

Name: Tyler Punch

4. Describe your something cool: I altered the delay between reads to 5 
seconds and check if the temperature has increased by 2 degrees in that span 
of time and if so then the temperature has chnaged enough that a message
is displayed alerting the user of interferance.


5. a. Hard real-time, brakes will save your life.
   b. Soft real-time, doesn't matter if it takes 2 seconds result still the same.
   c. Firm real-time. if not maintained video will be useless.
   d. One disadvantage is SPI requires more wires. 
   e. One advantage is that it is potentially faster, being full-duplex
   f. No the temperature sensor is unable to transmit current that far 
   g. Linux has unknown overhead timing so real-time operation can not be garunteed.

6. a. Nothing, it's a blackhole directory so anything that's written there just
dissapears.
   b. you get a write error: no space left.
   c. It could be useful to initialize data storage.
   d. I would be very confident in saying it contains random numbers.
