ECE 471 Fall 2019 -- Homework 3

Name: Tyler Punch

Answer to Question #3a:

#1 Adjust pointer to the end of the buffer

#2

Describe your something cool: For my something cool I made the count backwards
from 15 to 0.

Answer to Question #7:

a. hello_world = 628 / hello_world.thumb = 608 / hello_world.thumb2 = 612
It can be observed that the thumb executables are slightly smaller than the
arm assembly executable.

b. hello_world (HW 2) = 5544. All assembly executables are significantly smaller
than the c executable from HW 2 even though the code density was much smaller in HW 2 
 
c. I would want to use thumb assembly language because it is one tenth the size
of C. If space is a concern then thumb assembly would ensure I am using less space.

d. C was much easier for me to write, and a lot faster. My experience with assembly
is lacking so it's very hard for me to understand assembly whereas I have done
loads of work in c/c++ so doing a simple hello_world program was child play.

Answer to Question #8a: There is very clearly a bug in cal 9 1752. Im assuming
since Linux wasnt around until the 1970's that due to an issue with memory 
that those 12 days went missing. Im not really sure exactly how this occured but 
those 12 days seemed to have just dissapeared.
